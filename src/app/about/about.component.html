<h2>About the database</h2>
<p>
    Three different levels of 'explicitness' are assigned to characters. These describe how the a-spec 
    elements of the character are portrayed in the work. These are:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Word Used - a specific word indicating their a-spec identity is used in the text of the work.</li>
    <li>Described - a word is not used, but the identity is described sufficiently to be understandable as an a-spec one.</li>
    <li>
        Other Works - neither word nor description is included in this work, but the character appears 
        in other works where they are named or described.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    In the case where different parts of the character's identity (eg. romantic and sexual orientation) are 
    described at different levels of explicitness, the most explicit will be used.
</p>
<p>
    Additionally, characters may use multiple labels, such as identifying with an umbrella label and a microlabel. 
    When this is the case, the more specific label will be used.
</p>
<p>
    It is also possible to filter works on various intersectionalities. These will select works where an a-spec 
    character in the work identifiably also belongs to one of the marginalised groups listed. It will not included
    cases where non-a-spec characters in the work belongs to one of these groups.
</p>
<p>
    While this database is focused on short stories, short fiction which can go unnoticed can vary in length. To 
    highlight the works which vary from short story length, a badge is placed on the listing. These are:
</p>
<p><app-length-badge [lengthId] = "1"></app-length-badge> - Novella ~ 17,500 - 40,000 words</p>
<p><app-length-badge [lengthId] = "2"></app-length-badge> - Novelette ~ 7,000 - 17,000 words</p>
<p><app-length-badge [lengthId] = "3"></app-length-badge> - Flash Fiction ~ < 1,000 words</p>
<h2>Other Aromantic and Asexual Story Databases</h2>
<p>There are a number of other databases where stories with aromantic 
    and asexual spectrum characters can be found. These are listed below.</p>

                The AroAce Database is great for finding a-spec stories mostly from around 2021 or before. 
                It also contains a lot of more obscure indie/self published books that are not easily recorded in 
                other databases and lists. It's character based, although you can easily find information about 
                what books each character appears in, what genre those books are, the most important type of relationship 
                for each character, and any particular notes and warnings.

                The aro & ace book database is great for finding more recent books and for searching for particular 
                types of representation. This database is book/series based, and you can filter by format, genre, 
                identity, importance of representation to the story, and main/side characters. The creator of the 
                database has read all of the books on it and is still actively adding books to it as of February 2024. 
                In addition, they leave a reasonably detailed description for each entry about the representation in it.
